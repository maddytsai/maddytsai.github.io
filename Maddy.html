			My Love,
			<br>
			<br>
			There are a thousand ways to express my feelings, may it be through the words i love you or the smallest things that i do for you.
You have proved that you love me unconditionally time and again. 
You were that person who was constantly by my side supporting and encouraging me, even if the world was against me 
I have known ever since that day you wiped my tears, you were the one for me.
I will try to love you and take care of you as much and as well as I can. 
Please believe and trust me in whatever may come. 
Please forgive me if I ever hurt you or caused you pain. 
I love you for now til eternity. 
			<br>
<br>
<br>
			From,
			<br>
			Maddy
